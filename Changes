add external redirects Registry tests [Stas Bekman]

get rid of the compat layer in ModPerl-Registry [Stas Bekman]

ModPerl::RegistryLoader is now fully operational and tested [Stas Bekman]

Registry method handlers are now working [Stas Bekman]

core Registry packages all compile the scripts into
ModPerl::RegistryROOT:: namespace and cache them in
%ModPerl::RegistryCache. Both overridable by the sub-classes. [Stas Bekman]

compat tests were split into groups by functionality, send_fd test
moved to compat.  [Stas Bekman]

added $c->get_remote_host and a compat wrapper $r->get_remote_host +
tests [Stas Bekman]

adjust the build system to support mod_perl build from the source
tree. [Stas Bekman]

ModPerl::RegistryCooker syncs with mod_perl 1.0's registry:
 - prototypes defined checks in flush_namespace 
                            [Yair Lenga <yair.lenga@citigroup.com>]
 - set error-notes on error [Geoff Young <geoff@modperlcookbook.org>]
 - preserve status in Registry scripts [Geoff Young <geoff@modperlcookbook.org>]

apr_table_t is now an opaque type, use apr_table_elts() to get the array
record [Stas Bekman]


=item 1.99_04 - June 21, 2002

various APR PerlIO updates [Stas Bekman]

stop using an apr_pool_t to allocate items for the interpreter pool,
safer for threaded MPMs and prevents "leaks" when interpreters are
removed from due to PerlInterpMax{Requests,Spare}

implement modperl_sys_dlclose() to avoid apr/pool overhead/thread issues

get the -DPERL_CORE optimization working again

PERL_SET_CONTEXT to the parent interpreter when cloning interpreters at
request time, else dTHX might be NULL during clone in the given thread,
which would crash the server.

=item 1.99_03 - June 15, 2002

win32 fix for the global Apache->request object to make sure it uses
the thread local storage mechanism

add a reference count mechanism to interpreters for use in threaded MPMs,
so if APR::Pool cleanups have been registered the interpreter is not
putback into the interpreter pool until all cleanups have run.

unbuffer STDERR (by turning on autoflush by default)

add support for Perl*Handler +Apache::Foo

fix open_logs,post_config,child_init hooks to run in the proper order

adjust to apr_bucket_type_t changes in 2.0.37-dev
[Mladen Turk <mturk@mappingsoft.com>]

add MODPERL2 config define, as if the server had been started with -DMODPERL2

compat additions and fixes: $r->lookup_{file,uri}, $r->is_main, Apache->define

added compat for Apache::log_error [Stas Bekman]

=item 1.99_02 - June 1, 2002

pass the PATH and TZ environment variables at startup by default as 1.xx did

fix ModPerl::Util::exit segv with 5.6.0

no longer support 5.7.x perl development versions

added compat for Apache::Table->new

various fixes to compile/run on darwin

server-scope Perl{Set,Pass}Env config now propagated to %ENV at startup

use SvOK(sv) instead of sv == &PL_sv_undef to detect undef values in xs
[Stephen Clouse <stephenc@theiqgroup.com>]

complete Apache::Util 1.x compat

added Apache::MPM_IS_THREADED constant

added compat function for Apache::Constants::SERVER_VERSION

added Apache::Constants::export stub for compat

added noop stubs for timeout functions removed from 2.0:
$r->{soft,hard,reset,kill}_timeout

turned on PerlOptions +GlobalRequest by default for perl-script handler
unless it is explicitly turned off with PerlOptions -GlobalRequest

added APR::OS::thread_current function

added support for 1.x $r->subprocess_env functionality

added support for $r->push_handlers(PerlHandler => ...)

added support for $r->proxyreq to detect proxy requests

$r->content_type($val) now calls ap_set_content_type underneath

add the err_header_out() wrapper to Apache::compat + corresponding tests
[Stas Bekman]

fix $r->dir_config lookup of values set in the server context

added Apache::REDIRECT shortcut constant

various fixes for method handlers

use Apache::ServerUtil in Apache::compat so Apache->server works in compat
mode [Dave Rolsky <autarch@urth.org>]

add Apache::Util::unescape_uri alias to Apache::unescape_url in Apache::compat

change Apache::unescape_url to return the escaped url as 1.x does

disabled term coloring by default (enable with env var APACHE_TEST_COLOR=1)

fix for APR::IpSubnet->new to check return status apr_ipsubnet_create

enabled APR::SockAddr module

turn on binmode for filehandle used in $r->send_fd

get MP_{TRACE,DEBUG} Makefile.PL options working on win32

various fixes to build/run with bleedperl

various fixes for win32 to get make test passing

moved constuct_{url,server} methods to Apache::URI module

implement Apache::URI::parse in Apache::compat

give Perl*Handlers precedence over other handlers by using APR_HOOK_FIRST
rather than APR_HOOK_LAST

workaround bug in 5.6.1 when XSLoader loads DynaLoader, wiping out any
dl handles it had been keeping track of.

tidy up test to run standalone (without modperl test config) 
[Stas Bekman]

override T_PTROBJ INPUT typemap to croak if object is not a blessed
reference, to prevent possible segv from e.g. Apache::Server->process

apr_lock.h is gone; disable APR::Lock for the moment

enabled the Apache::Process module

fix ModPerl::Util::exit to clear $@ before calling Perl_croak

cut down on some build noise

fix 'PerlOptions +GlobalRequest' when used within subrequests

get rid of some "subroutine redefined" warnings in ModPerl::MM that
show up with newer bleedperls.
