    # find the other pools and use them as they own. for example they
    # could destroy the pools, and the perl objects of the pair would
    # have no idea that someone has destroyed the pools without their
    # knowledge. the previous implementation suffered from this
    # problem. the new implementation uses an SV which is stored in
    # the object and in the pool. when the pool is destroyed the SV
    # gets its IVX pointer set to 0, which affects any perl object
    # that is a ref to that SV. so once an apr pool is destroyed all
    # perl objects pointing to it get automatically invalidated and
    # there is no risk of hijacking newly created pools that happen to
    # be at the same memory address.
