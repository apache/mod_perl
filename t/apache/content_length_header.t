# 1. because Apache proclaims itself governor of the C-L header via
# the C-L filter (ap_content_length_filter at
# httpd-2.0/server/protocol.c), test whether GET and HEAD behave the
# same wrt C-L under varying circumstances.  for the most part GET
# and HEAD should behave exactly the same.  however, when Apache
# sees a HEAD request with a C-L header of zero it takes special
# action and removes the C-L header.  this is done to protect against
# handlers that called r->header_only (which was ok in 1.3 but is
# not in 2.0).  So, GET and HEAD behave the same except when the
# content handler (plus filters) end up sending no content.  see
# the lengthy comments in ap_http_header_filter in http_protocol.c.
#
# for more discussion on
# why it is important to get HEAD requests right, see these threads
# from the mod_perl list

# are using HEAD requests in the wild

# 2. even though the spec says that content handlers should send an
# identical response for GET and HEAD requests, some folks try to
# avoid the overhead of generating the response body, which Apache is
# going to discard anyway for HEAD requests. The following discussion
# assumes that we deal with a HEAD request.
#
# When Apache sees EOS and no headers and no response body were sent,
# ap_content_length_filter (httpd-2.0/server/protocol.c) sets C-L to
# 0. Later on ap_http_header_filter
# (httpd-2.0/modules/http/http_protocol.c) removes the C-L header for
# the HEAD requests
#
# the workaround is to force the sending of the response headers,
# before EOS was sent. The simplest solution is to use rflush():
#
# if ($r->header_only) { # HEAD
#     $body_len = calculate_body_len();
#     $r->set_content_length($body_len);
#     $r->rflush;
# }
# else {                 # GET
#     # generate and send the body
# }
#
# now if the handler sets the C-L header it'll be delivered to the
# client unmodified.

    # if the response handler sends data (e.g. one char string), and
    # sets C-L header, the client gets the C-L header
