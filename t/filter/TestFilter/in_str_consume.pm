package TestFilter::in_str_consume;

# this test verifies that streaming filters framework handles
# gracefully the case when a filter doesn't print anything at all to
# the caller.

# the real problem is that in the streaming filters we can't consume
# more than one bucket brigade during a single filter invocation,
# which we can in non-stream filters., (e.g. see in_bbs_underrun.pm)
#
# it seems that this works just fine (2.0.46+) and older httpds
# had problems when a filter invocation hasn't printed a thing.
#
# currently if the streaming filter doesn't print anything, the
# upstream filter gets an empty brigade brigade (easily verified with
# the snooping debug filter). Of course if the filter returns
# Apache::DECLINED the unconsumed data will be passed to upstream filter
#
# However this filter has a problem. Since it doesn't consume all the
# data, the client is left with un-read data, and when the response is
# sent a client get the broken pipe on the socket. It seems that LWP
# on linux handles that situation gracefully, but not on win32, where
# it silently dies. Other clients may have similar problems as
# well. The proper solution is to consume all the data till EOS and
# just drop it on the floor if it's unneeded. Unfortunately we waste
# the resources of passing the data through all filters in the chain
# and doing a wasteful work, but currently there is no way to tell the
# in_core network filter to discard all the data without passing it
# upstream. Notice that in this test we solve the problem in a
# different manner, we simply call $r->discard_request_body which does
# the trick. However it's inappropriate for a stand-alone filter, who
# should read all the data in instead.
#
# this test receives about 10 bbs
# it reads only the first 23 bytes of each bb and discards the rest
# since it wants only 105 bytes it partially consumes only the first 5 bbs
# since it doesn't read all the data in, it'll never see EOS
# therefore once it has read all 105 bytes, it manually sets the EOS flag
# and the rest of the bbs are ignored, the filter is invoked only 5 times
#
# to debug this filter run it as:
#
# t/TEST -v -trace=debug filter/in_str_consume
#
# to enable upstream and downstream filter snooping, uncomment the
# snooping filters directives at the end of this file and rerun:
# t/TEST -conf
#
# to see what happens inside the filter, assuming that you built
# mod_perl with MP_TRACE=1, run:
# env MOD_PERL_TRACE=f t/TEST -v -trace=debug filter/in_str_consume
#
