package TestFilter::in_bbs_inject_header;

# this filter demonstrates two things:
# 1. how to write a filter that will work only on HTTP headers
# 2. how to inject extra HTTP headers
#
# the first task is simple for non-keepalive connections -- as soon as
# a bucket which matches /^[\r\n]+$/ is read we can store that event
# in the filter context and simply 'return Apache::DECLINED on the
# future invocation, so not to slow things.
#
# it becomes much trickier with keepalive connection, since Apache
# provides no API to tell you whether a new request is coming in. We
# use $c->keepalives to figure out when a new request is coming in, by
# comparing the previously stored keepalives count, which gets
# incremented by Apache when the HTTP response headers are generated.
#
#
# the second task is a bit trickier, as the headers_in core httpd
# filter is picky and it wants each header to arrive in a separate
# bucket, and moreover this bucket needs to be in its own brigade.
# so this test arranges for this to happen.
#
# the test shows how to push headers at the end of all headers
# and in the middle, whichever way you prefer.
