package TestFilter::in_bbs_underrun;

# this test exercises the underrun filter concept. Sometimes filters
# need to read at least N bytes before they can apply they
# transformation. It's quite possible that reading one bucket brigade
# is not enough. But two or more are needed.
#
# When the filter realizes that it doesn't have enough data, it can
# stash the read data in the context, and wait for the next
# invocation, meanwhile it must return an empty bb to the filter that
# has called it. This is not efficient. Instead of returning an empty
# bb to a caller, the input filter can initiate the retrieval of extra
# bucket brigades, after one was received. Notice that this is
# absolutely transparent to any filters before or after the current
# filter.
#
# to see the filter at work, run it as:
# t/TEST -trace=debug -v filter/in_bbs_underrun
#
# and look in the error_log. You will see something like:
#
# ==> TestFilter::in_bbs_underrun::handler : filter called
# ==> asking for a bb
# ==> asking for a bb
# ==> asking for a bb
# ==> storing the remainder: 7611 bytes
# ==> TestFilter::in_bbs_underrun::handler : filter called
# ==> asking for a bb
# ==> asking for a bb
# ==> storing the remainder: 7222 bytes
# ==> TestFilter::in_bbs_underrun::handler : filter called
# ==> asking for a bb
# ==> seen eos, flushing the remaining: 8182 bytes
#
# it's clear from the log that the filter was invoked 3 times, however
# it has consumed 6 bucket brigades
#
# finally, we have to note that this is impossible to do with
# streaming filters, since they can only read data from one bucket
# brigade. So you must process bucket brigades.
