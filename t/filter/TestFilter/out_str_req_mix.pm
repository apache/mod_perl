package TestFilter::out_str_req_mix;

# in this test we verify that we can preserve the mixed order of
# modperl and non-modperl filters using the PerlSetOutputFilter
# directive, instead of SetOutputFilter for non-modperl filters.
#
# response handler prints a mangled SSI directive:
#     <!--#include virtual="/includes/REMOVEclear.shtml" -->
# (which it receives via POST from the client)
#
# adjust() filter is configured to be called first and it removes the
# string 'REMOVE' from the response handler's output, so that SSI will
# find the fixed resource specification:
#     <!--#include virtual="/includes/clear.shtml" -->
#
# the INCLUDES filter, which is configured to be next on the stack
# (mod_include) processes the directive and returns the contents of
# file "/includes/clear.shtml", which is:
#    This is a REMOVEclear text
#
# finally the second mod_perl filter (which happens to be the same
# adjust() filter, but to all purposes it's a separate filter)
# configured to run after the INCLUDES filter fixes the data sent by
# the INCLUDES filter to be:
#    This is a clear text
#
# and this is what the client is expecting to receive
#
# WARNING: notice that the adjust() filter assumes that it'll receive
# the word REMOVE in a single bucket, which is good enough for the
# test because we control all the used filters and normally Apache
# core filters won't split short data into several buckets.  However
# filter developers shouldn't make any assumptions, since any data can
# be split by any of the upstream filters.
