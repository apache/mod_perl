This is mod_perl version 2.0-tobe

*** Prerequisites ***

Apache:
  The DSO version of mod_perl works with Apache versions 2.0.46 -
  2.0.50. The static version -- with Apache versions 2.0.51 - 2.0.51.
  Newer Apache versions may work with this version of mod_perl.  If
  not, the cvs version likely will, which can be obtained from:
  http://perl.apache.org/download/source.html#Development_mod_perl_2_0_Source_Distribution

Perl: 
  Perl version 5.6.1 or higher is required. mod_perl builds with 5.6.0,
  but is not supported if you have problems using it.

  Perl version 5.8.0 or higher is required for threaded MPMs (worker,
  winnt, etc.).

*** Status ***

mod_perl is currently considered beta when used with the prefork MPM.

mod_perl is currently considered alpha when used with a threaded MPM.

Only DSO build of mod_perl-2.0 is currently supported, static builds
will be support in the future.

*** Documentation ***

Documentation can be found in the docs/ directory. Currently they
don't get installed on 'make install'. Certain API documentation can
be found in docs/api/.  The online version is at
http://perl.apache.org/docs/2.0/.

*** Todo ***

mod_perl-2.0-tobe is not 100% feature complete with the 1.xx version.
See the files in the todo/ directory for what remains to be done. Some
of those features will be implemented after 2.0 is released. The goal
is to empty the file todo/release and document/test/verify the API
that's going to be supported by 2.0. More API will be supported post
2.0 release.
