This is mod_perl version 2.0

*** Prerequisites ***

Apache:
  Dynamic mod_perl (DSO):    Apache 2.0.47 - 2.2.22.
  Static mod_perl:           Apache 2.0.51 - 2.2.22.

  Newer Apache versions may work with this version of mod_perl.  If
  not, the svn version likely will, which can be obtained from:
  http://perl.apache.org/download/source.html#Development_mod_perl_2_0_Source_Distribution

Perl:

    + non-prefork mpm:
      - Perl with    ithreads support version 5.8.0 or higher

  Static mod_perl:

*** Status ***

mod_perl is currently considered stable.


*** Documentation ***

Documentation can be found in the docs/ directory. Currently they
don't get installed on 'make install'. Certain API documentation can
be found in docs/api/.  The online version is at
http://perl.apache.org/docs/2.0/.

*** Todo ***

mod_perl-2.0 is not 100% feature complete with the 1.xx version.
See the files in the todo/ directory for what remains to be done. Some
of those features will be implemented after 2.0 is released. The goal
is to empty the file todo/release and document/test/verify the API
that's going to be supported by 2.0. More API will be supported post
2.0 release.
