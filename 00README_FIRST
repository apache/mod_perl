a (nearly) complete rewrite is underway for mod_perl-2.0

the module is not usable yet, at least not the way 1.xx is

what you see here is just a start on the new build/glue infrastructure

more detailed design docs, etc. will follow along with updates here
and on the list

if you want to try building with an interpreter pool, you'll need Perl
5.6.0 with patches/perl_no_get_context.pat applied and Perl built like 
so:

% ./Configure -des -Dusethreads -Accflags=-DPERL_NO_GET_CONTEXT

mod_perl-2.0 will still work with an out-of-the-box Perl, but will
only be useful if your mpm is prefork (which is much like 1.3.x)

in either case, in this directory run:

% perl Makefile.PL -c -ma

% cd ../apache-2.0/src
% ./configure --prefix=$HOME/apache-2.0 --with-mpm=mpmt_pthread
% patch -p1 < ../modperl-2.0/patches/link-hack.pat
% make

as for httpd.conf, mine looks something like so at the moment:

#same as using the MOD_PERL_TRACE environment variable

PerlTrace all

#only with -Dusethreads
PerlInterpStart 3
PerlInterpMax 4

#PerlRequire/PerlModule/etc will return, in the meantime, this
#directive passes arbitrary command line switches to perl

PerlSwitches -T /home/dougm/test/startup.pl
