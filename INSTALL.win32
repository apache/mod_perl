INSTALL.win32 - Apache mod_perl installation instructions for Win32

=head1 DESCRIPTION

How to build, test, configure and install mod_perl under Win32

=head1 PREREQUSITES

=over 3

patience - mod_perl is considered alpha under NT and Windows95.

MSVC++ 5.0+, Apache version 1.3-dev or higher and Perl 5.004_02 or higher.

mod_perl will _not_ work with Activeware's port, only with the "official"
Perl, available from: http://www.perl.com/CPAN/src/5.0/latest.tar.gz

=head1 BUILDING

=over 3

=item Binaries

It is possible that binaries of ApacheModulePerl.dll will be made
available from:
http://www.perl.com/CPAN/authors/id/DOUGM/

=item Setup the Perl side

run 'perl Makefile.PL'
run 'nmake install'

This will install the Perl side of mod_perl and setup files for the library build.

=item Build ApacheModulePerl.dll

Using MS developer studio, 
select "File -> Open Workspace ...", 
select "Files of type [Projects (*.dsp)]"
browse and open mod_perl-x.xx/src/modules/ApacheModulePerl/ApacheModulePerl.dsp

=item Settings

select "Tools -> Options -> [Directories]"

select "Show directories for: [Include files]"

You'll need to add the following paths:
C:\apache_x.xx\src\main
C:\apache_x.xx\src\regex
.  (should be expanded to C:\...\mod_perl-x.xx\src\modules\perl for you)
C:\perl\lib\Core

select "Project -> Add to Project -> Files" adding:
perl.lib       (e.g. C:\perl\lib\Core\perl.lib)
ApacheCore.lib (e.g. C:\Apache\ApacheCore.lib)

select "Build -> Set Active Configuration... -> [ApacheModulePerl - Win32 Release]"

select "Build -> Build ApacheModulePerl.dll"

You may see some harmless warnings, which can be reduced (along with
the size of the DLL), by setting:

"Project -> Settings -> [C/C++] -> Category: [Code Generation] -> 
  Use runtime library: [Multithreaded DLL]

=item Testing

Once ApacheModulePerl.dll is built and apache.exe in installed you may
test mod_perl with:

 nmake test

=item Apache setup

You do not need to rebuild apache, just copy ApacheModulePerl.dll to
$SERVER_ROOT/modules 

=back

=head1 CONFIGURATION

Add this line to httpd.conf:

 LoadModule perl_module modules/ApacheModulePerl

Be sure that 'C:\perl\bin' is in your path so apache can find perl.dll

See the cgi_to_mod_perl.pod and mod_perl.pod documents for general
configuration.

=head1 NOTES

mod_perl-win32 is considered alpha, at the time of this writing, so is
Apache-NT (1.3a1)

CGI::Switch does not work with apache_1.3a1 because basic_http_header() 
is not exported by the ApacheCore.dll  For now, just change:

 use CGI::Switch ();
 my $q = CGI::Switch->new;

 - to -

 use CGI ();
 my $q = CGI->new;
