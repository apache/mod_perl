in no particular order:

provide namespace protection for mod_include #perl's

port to threaded 5.004_5x (5.005-tobe)

win32:
- integrate with Perl 5.005's threading
- Apache and Apache::Constants should be built as dlls
- look at providing ASP (Active Server Plugin) support for NT users

special treatment for nph- scripts?

overload %ENV magic so it's not setup unless asked for

"save stack" mechanism so we can go back to caching CV lookups

cleanup Makefile.PL!!!

extend $r->notes method so we can store arbitrary Perl structures

think about re-introducing perl_alloc..perl_free option for each
request now that embedding bugs are fixed in Perl 5.004  

Apache::Registry should honor __END__ and __DATA__,
but how to get it right?

improve the "stacked handlers" implementation, including:
- config merging of AV*'s

-allowing all array-like operations besides push_handlers,
pop_handlers, shift_handlers, unshift_handlers, splice_handlers, etc.

-allow push_handlers to have an additional argument, an array ref,
which will be passed to the handler as arguments, e.g.
 $r->push_handlers("PerlHandler", \&some_sub, ['one', 'two', 'etc']);

-allow Perl*Handler's to have arguments in config files, e.g.:

 PerlHandler FooPackage [One Two Three]
 (calls &FooPackage::handler($r, "One", "Two", "Three");

allow <Perl></Perl> configuration sections to have read access to internal
configuration structures (would be nice if we could tie a %namespace::) 
 
explore mechanisms for sharing database connections amoung server children

figure out good way to route request to specific child to maintain state

find a good way to make Apache::exit override CORE::exit no matter where we are

find more ways to decrease size of httpd (perl-runtime!)

more tests for the test suite

add more examples
