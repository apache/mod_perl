libaprutil Libraries)





=head1 Synopsis

  use APR ();






=head1 Description

On load this modules prepares the APR enviroment (initializes memory
pools, data structures, etc.)

You don't need to use this module explicitly, since it's already
loaded internally by all C<APR::*> modules.






=head1 Using APR modules outside mod_perl 2.0

You'd use the C<APR::*> modules outside mod_perl 2.0, just like you'd
use it with mod_perl 2.0. For example to get a random unique string
you could call:

  % perl -MApache2 -MAPR::UUID -le 'print APR::UUID->new->format'
