The files under this directory document the API of mod_perl project
and its sub-projects. Since for mod_perl 2.0 most of the code is
autogenerated it's much easier to keep the documentation in a separate
place.

Keeping all the docs under the same directory makes it easy to
distribute only the documentation, especially simplify the build,
since they all live in a separate modperl-docs project.

That's said, when you send in new patches, from now on please don't
forget to send documentation patches. It's much easier and nicer to
document as we go, then doing this at then end.

If you create a new pod file, try to follow the conventions used in
other pod files under the same tree.
