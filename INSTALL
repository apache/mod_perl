Simple install:

% perl Makefile.PL MP_APXS=/usr/local/apache2/bin/apxs
% make && make test
% make install

If Apache was built but not installed yet or if apxs is not available
and Apache was installed under a single tree (e.g.,
/usr/local/apache2), you should use the MP_AP_PREFIX option, which
points that the Apache tree:

% perl Makefile.PL MP_AP_PREFIX=/usr/local/apache2

See docs/user/install/install.pod for details.

Simple config:

LoadModule perl_module modules/mod_perl.so

If the MP_INST_APACHE2=1 option was given to Makefile.PL, you'll want
to configure:

PerlModule Apache2

For compat with the 1.x version, you'll want to configure:

PerlModule Apache::compat

See docs/user/config/config.pod for details.
