#XXX: dl_dlopen.xs check isn't portable; works for hpux
# - on aix this is dl_aix.xs, and depending on release, RTDL_GLOBAL is
#   available or not, e.g. 4.3 doesn't have it in the headers, while
#   5.1 does have it
# - from looking at ext/DynaLoader/dl_*.xs when 0x01 is used when it's
#   not supported perl issues a warning and passes the right flag to dlopen
# - currently (patchlevel 18958) dl_aix.xs always issues a warning
#   even when RTDL_GLOBAL is available, patch submitted to p5p
