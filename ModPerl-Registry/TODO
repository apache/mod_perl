RegistryCooker:

### bugs ###

- prototyping sub handler($$) segfaults on request

### missing features ###

- need to port $Apache::__T, to test against when user supplies -T flag.

- port Apache::PerlRunXS

- implement RegistryLoader (per module or a single one?)

- implement slurp_filename and remove Apache::compat

- $r->chdir_file is not handled/implemented, see todo/api.txt unsafe!

- $Apache::Server::CWD doesn't exist

- NameWithVirtualHost is not handled

- need to figure out what's happening with
  ModPerl::Registry::MarkLine, why it's not on by default?

- a cousin of convert_script_to_compiled_handler() in 1.x used to have
  'undef &{"$o->[PACKAGE]\::handler"}' to avoid redefine handler()
  warnings in case a user has used -w. also see the undef_functions on
  the next line.

- child_terminate is not implemented see
  convert_script_to_compiled_handler().

- print STDERR is buffered in test handlers, whereas warn() works
  normally. select() helps, but STDERR should be unbuffered in first
  place.

### optimizations ###

- $o->[CLASS] of the subclass is known at compile time, so should
  create the subs using $o->[CLASS] on the fly for each subclass
  which wants them

### nice to have ###

- in namespace_from_filename() should test whether a file is a symlink
  and if so use readlink() to get the real filename.

### other things ###

- Bjarni R. Einarsson <bre@klaki.net> has suggested this Registry hack
