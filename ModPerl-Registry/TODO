 - print STDERR is buffered in test handlers, whereas warn() works
   normally. select() helps, but STDERR should be unbuffered in first
   place.

DougM: well, if possible we should distinguish between the uri and
requested resource instead.  in otherwords, we have the: r->uri =>
r->filename translation, just need to figure out if r->filename is the
actual filename or a symlink (readlink can be used to get the real
filename).  then create a package based on the filename, but with as
few package:: levels as possible (hopefully none beyond
ModPerl::RegistryROOT::filename)

DougM: using filenames makes for long packages names == lengthy
lookups and more memory than we need.  at least the way it is
currently implemented where each '/' turns into '::'.  could be that
s,/,_,g is good enough, but haven't thought about this for a while.
in any case, we should get rid of the NameWithVirtualHost stuff, its
caused too many problems in the past.
