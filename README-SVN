this is a very simple document that outlines some of the important
details about the mod_perl svn repository.


LAYOUT

the mod_perl project at the Apache Software Foundation lives here

  http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/perl/

and uses the following structure

  modperl/trunk           # equivalent to cvs HEAD - currently
                          # the mod_perl 2.0 development branch

  modperl/tags            # every official mod_perl release

  modperl/docs/trunk      # the mod_perl documentation project


DEVELOPER ACCESS

assuming you have already been granted commit access to the repository,
you should follow these steps to checkout mod_perl

  $ ssh svn.apache.org svnpasswd
  $ svn checkout https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/perl/modperl/trunk/ mod_perl-2.0

if you want to test that your commit access is working, this file is
an acceptable place to take a test drive.
