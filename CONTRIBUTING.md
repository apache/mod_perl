# How to Contribute

Help with mod_perl is always welcome. You do not have to know any code
to help out - we also need help testing, answering questions, improving
documentation, etc.


## Issues

Bugs and problems can be reported at:

https://rt.cpan.org/Dist/Display.html?Name=mod_perl

which can be accessed from the "Issues" link in the left-hand menu on
the metacpan.org page, https://metacpan.org/pod/mod_perl2 .

(Note: You will need to log in to https://rt.cpan.org in order to get
the "Report a new bug" button on the bug tracker page.)


### Discussions

There is a low-volume mailing list for mod_perl users and developers to
share ideas, solve problems and discuss things related to mod_perl and
the Apache::* modules.

Send an email to <modperl@perl.apache.org>. Before doing so, you should
subscribe by sending an email to <modperl-subscribe@perl.apache.org>.
Send an email to <modperl-unsubscribe@perl.apache.org> to unsubscribe.

There is also a low-volume mailing list for discussions about the
development of the core mod_perl.

Send an email to <dev@perl.apache.org>. Before doing so, you should
subscribe by sending an email to <dev-subscribe@perl.apache.org>.
Send an email to <dev-unsubscribe@perl.apache.org> to unsubscribe.


## Testing

You can help by testing mod_perl as widely as possible. Running the
tests on a wide variety of platforms, Apache httpd versions, Perl
versions and other factors is a great help in uncovering problems and
improving mod_perl.


## Code development

Development happens in a Subversion repo. The canonical location is
currently at:

https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/perl/

The current mod_perl 2.0 development branch is at modperl/trunk under
the above URL.

Create your own copy of that branch by running:

svn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/perl/modperl/trunk/ mod_perl2
