this file contains known missing features from 1.3, these are to be
implemented unless otherwise noted.  there are more missing features
listed in deprecated_features.txt

- anonymous handler (for push_handlers, add_input_filter, etc), see
  modperl_mgv.c: modperl_mgv_name_from_sv

- PerlCleanupHandler

- PerlModule, PerlRequire, Perl{Set,Add}Var in .htaccess is missing

- modperl_include #perl

- PerlOpCodeMask (experimental in 1.xx)

- cgi emulation: %ENV management:
   - %ENV is currently only saved/restored for the perl-script
     handler, i.e. changes to %ENV outside of a perl-script handler
     are not cleared.  of course, "clean" modules would use local() to
     modify %ENV, but there should be an option to save/restore
     globals outside of the perl-script handler
 
   - see if we can avoid touching environ[] until a fork() from Perl happens

- die 404;

- ... others ...

- Apache::__T flag which tells whether we run under -T (in 5.8.0 can check
  ${^TAINT})
