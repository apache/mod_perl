this file contains known missing features from 1.3, these are to be
implemented unless otherwise noted.  there are more missing features
listed in deprecated_features.txt

- DirectiveHandlers

- PerlCleanupHandler

- PerlSetEnv, PerlPassEnv

- PerlModule, PerlRequire, Perl{Set,Add}Var in .htacess is missing

- pod directives (=pod,=back,=cut) and __END__

- <Perl> sections

- modperl_include #perl

- PerlOpCodeMask (experimental in 1.xx)

- PerlFreshRestart

- cgi emulation: %ENV management:
   - %ENV is currently only saved/restored for the perl-script
     handler, i.e. changes to %ENV outside of a perl-script handler
     are not cleared.  of course, "clean" modules would use local() to
     modify %ENV, but there should be an option to save/restore
     globals outside of the perl-script handler
 
   - see if we can avoid touching environ[] until a fork() from Perl happens
