# mp1 missing features #
########################

### try to get this first post 2.0 release ###

* directive handlers are supported but need some work for 1.x compat
  - Apache::CmdParms::{GETC,getline} needs compat mapping, similar to
    what Apache::Directive->as_string does, but one char or line at a time

  - Automatic setting of cmd_args in @APACHE_MODULE_DIRECTIVE based on
    function prototype

* tied filehandle interface:
 -EOF, TELL, SEEK
 -READLINE - proper implementation (see comment in Apache::compat)
 need to attempt to fix that interface so it'll work with IPC::Open* family  

### other, less important things ###

* $r->last is missing (it was provided explicitly by modperl, it's not
  an apache thing) see modperl/src/modules/perl/Apache.xs

* automate generation of xs/tables/current/apr/FunctionTable.pm
  via Apache::ParseSource. This file contains a subset of
  functions appearing in ModPerl::FunctionTable that are
  needed when building APR.so, and is used when generating
  the def/exp files on Win32/AIX.

* Apache::PerlSections missing features for backwards compatibility:
 - $Apache::ReadConfig::DocumentRoot
 - Apache::PerlSections->store(filename)

  Report: Philippe M. Chiasson <gozer@cpan.org>
  Status: Philippe M. Chiasson <gozer@cpan.org> is working on it

* PerlOpCodeMask (experimental in 1.xx)

* die 404 (consider deprecating it)

* mod_perl::import
  - Apache->import:
   required for exit/warn overridding

* Apache::test: tobe a compat stub around new test framework

* Apache::src: tobe a compat stub around new build framework

* hooks ordering is not implemented yet
  Owner: geoff

* $r->finfo:
  need apr_finfo_t <-> struct stat conversion (might already be there,
  haven't looked close enough yet)

* $r->chdir_file:
  not safe for threaded environments.  should at least unshift @INC
  with dirname $r->filename.  consider overriding open() to resolve
  relative filenames.

* size_string() - can we use apr_strfsize ?

* $r->send_fd:
  need to figure out howto map PerlIO <-> apr_file_t
  at the moment $r->send_fd is implement in Apache::compat, functions,
  but does not have the performance benefits of ap_send_fd()
  however, $r->sendfile is a new function that opens the file for you
  and calls ap_send_fd() underneath. ap_send_fd() in APR doesn't work 
  with fd's which aren't files and of unknown length, therefore it cannot 
  be used for implementing 1.x compatible send_fd.
  Solution: send_fd will require the length argument and there will be
  no send_fd without the length argument as in mp1
