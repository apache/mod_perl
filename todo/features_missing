# mp1 missing features #
########################

* Apache::PerlSections->dump 
  It does exist, but it's a completely internal function, not dumping existing configuration
  as it used to be in 1.x. (needed by Apache::Status, for instance). Need to be implemented
  and the existing dump method must be moved out of the way
 

* directive handlers are supported but need some work for 1.x compat
  - Apache::ModuleConfig->get needs a compat method mapping to
    Apache::Module->get_config

  - Apache::CmdParms::{GETC,getline} needs compat mapping, similar to
    what Apache::Directive->as_string does, but one char or line at a time

* Apache::PerlSections missing features for backwards compatibility:
 - $Apache::ReadConfig::DocumentRoot
 - Apache::PerlSections->store(filename)

  Report: Philippe M. Chiasson <gozer@cpan.org>
  Status: Philippe M. Chiasson <gozer@cpan.org> is working on it

* PerlOpCodeMask (experimental in 1.xx)

* die 404 (consider deprecating it)

* mod_perl.pm::import

- Apache::test: tobe a compat stub around new test framework

- Apache::src: tobe a compat stub around new build framework
