* extend add_config to support add_config($multi_line_config). If the
  passed argument is not a ref to an array, but a scalar should use
  CR?LF to do the line split

* PerlFooHandler -Bar is a NOOP when 'PerlOptions AutoLoad' is in
  effect, whereas it should prevent autloading.
  See:
  modperl_handler_new in modperl_handler.c
  modperl_hash_handlers in modperl_mgv.c

* filters tie handle/perlio interface

  both input/output filters should provide a tiehandle and/or perlio
  interface.

  Perl tiehandle methods include the following, '+' indicates must have, '-'
  indicates not possible / doesn't make sense (though might require noop
  stubs), '~' indicates would be nice if possible, '?' indicates unsure:
  
  + TIEHANDLE
  + PRINT
  + PRINTF
  + WRITE
  + READLINE
  + GETC
  + READ
  + CLOSE
  ? UNTIE
  ? DESTROY
  + BINMODE (noop)
  ? OPEN
  ~ EOF
  - FILENO
  ~ SEEK
  ~ TELL

* maybe functions in xs/maps/(apache|apr)_functions.map

* missing apr_buckets api: destroy, delete

*  Apache->request:
  need to deal with subclass objects which are not a request_rec
  (e.g. HASH ref)
