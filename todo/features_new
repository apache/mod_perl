* filters tie handle/perlio interface

  both input/output filters should provide a tiehandle and/or perlio
  interface.

  Perl tiehandle methods include the following, '+' indicates must have, '-'
  indicates not possible / doesn't make sense (though might require noop
  stubs), '~' indicates would be nice if possible, '?' indicates unsure:
  
  + TIEHANDLE
  + PRINT
  + PRINTF
  + WRITE
  + READLINE
  + GETC
  + READ
  + CLOSE
  ? UNTIE
  ? DESTROY
  + BINMODE (noop)
  ? OPEN
  ~ EOF
  - FILENO
  ~ SEEK
  ~ TELL

* maybe functions in xs/maps/(apache|apr)_functions.map
