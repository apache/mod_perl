someone has asked to make $r->request_time settable

-------------

MP_STATIC_EXTS=1 must link all extensions but APR.so. At the moment
the following are not linked:

  APR/Const.so APR/PerlIO.so Apache/Const.so ModPerl/Const.so

owner: ???

note: when testing MP_STATIC_EXTS=1 build we must ensure that there is
no preinstalled mod_perl2. Since if there is a preinstall of a normal
build, MP_STATIC_EXTS=1 will be not properly tested, as the
preinstalled .so modules will be loaded. A potential solution: when
MP_STATIC_EXTS=1 is used change .pm files not to load the .xs
extensions!

-------------

When running as root and A-T figures it can't run the test suite
(perms) it'll ask users if she wants to skip the test suite, if this
happens:

  Skip the test suite? [No] yes
  Skipping the test suite execution, while returning success status
  cd ModPerl-Registry && make test

she gets to run the registry test suite anyway, since the top level
test suite was successful (needed to make cpan/plus installers
happy). Not sure what's the best solution here.
