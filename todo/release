* need to review all the API methods that set string values
 (e.g. server_admin) they all assign a pointer to the PV slot in the
 perl scalar and if that scalar goes out of scope or changes, the
 modified data will get corrupted. need to replace 
   val = (char *)SvPV_nolen(...);
 with:
   val = apr_pstrdup(pool, (char *)SvPV_nolen(...));
but the problem with what pool is used is very delicate, for $s
methods it must be $s->pool and for $r methods, $r->pool, but some $r
methods try to modify server strings. like document_root, which I've
started to fix, but it's still broken (not sure what pool should be
used, $s->pool will mean a memory leak, $r->pool will still mean a
corrupted data).
