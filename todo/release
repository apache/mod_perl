* document_root needs to be restored at the end of request
  http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=110842294700006&r=1&w=2
  owner: joes

* need to review all the API methods that set string values
 (e.g. server_admin) they all assign a pointer to the PV slot in the
 perl scalar and if that scalar goes out of scope or changes, the
 modified data will get corrupted. need to replace 
   val = (char *)SvPV_nolen(...);
 with:
   val = apr_pstrdup(pool, (char *)SvPV_nolen(...));
but the problem with what pool is used is very delicate, for $s
methods it must be $s->pool and for $r methods, $r->pool, but some $r
methods try to modify server strings. like document_root, which I've
started to fix, but it's still broken (not sure what pool should be
used, $s->pool will mean a memory leak, $r->pool will still mean a
corrupted data).

Apache::ServerRec: (all autogenerated)
server_admin
server_hostname
error_fname
path
names
wild_names

those are non-pointer assignments (mostly int), so they need no
backup:

port
loglevel
timeout
keep_alive_timeout
keep_alive_max
keep_alive
limit_req_line
limit_req_fieldsize
limit_req_fields
