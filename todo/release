* pools that go out of scope:

  perl -MApache2 -MAPR::Pool -MAPR::PerlIO -le '; 
  open my $fh, "<:APR", "/tmp/xxx", APR::Pool->new; print <$fh>'
  APR::PerlIO::read: (9) Bad file descriptor at -e li

  first of all, try to never allow passing temp pools, e.g in the
  above example, we can check that the pool object doesn't have the
  TEMP flag on.

  but that doesn't really solve the problem. So we aren't sure how to
  deal with that.

* $bb->cleanup segfaults (originally in TestProtocol::echo_bbs2

* It'd be nice to have PAUSE and the clients support packages with
  several versions, like mod_perl 1.0 and mod_perl 2.0, since once we
  release it any dependency on mod_perl will be resolved as mod_perl
  2.0, when mod_perl 1.0 may be required instead.
  owner: stas: talked to autrijus, he will start working on it, but
               not sure when. we need to ping him every so often. but
               it'll probably won't happen by the time we release 2.0.
