-- see also todo/api_status

* rewrite the tests/docs not to remove the bucket until it was read
  from

* APR::URI missing $uri->rpath (was in mp1)

* Apache::RequestRec's $r->content_languages is missing (was in mp1)

* check other todo/features_missing items (some of them might be
  critical for 2.0 release, since missing methods might be a problem
  for migration)

* pools that go out of scope:

  perl -MApache2 -MAPR::Pool -MAPR::PerlIO -le '; 
  open my $fh, "<:APR", "/tmp/xxx", APR::Pool->new; print <$fh>'
  APR::PerlIO::read: (9) Bad file descriptor at -e li

  first of all, try to never allow passing temp pools, e.g in the
  above example, we can check that the pool object doesn't have the
  TEMP flag on.

  but that doesn't really solve the problem. So we aren't sure how to
  deal with that.

* $bb->cleanup segfaults (originally in TestProtocol::echo_bbs2
  http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=apache-modperl-dev&m=108967266419527&w=2
  owner: gozer

* on windows $pool->clean, followed by $pool->destroy breaks other tests
  See test TestAPR::pool
  http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=apache-modperl-dev&m=108547894817083&w=2

* consider changing the allocation method in APR::Bucket::new from
  malloc/free to bucket_alloc, like all other buckets do

* revamp directive handlers, expose modperl_module_add, fix
  PerlLoadModule, etc.
  owner: geoff

* PerlSetVar/PerlAddVar still do not merge properly.  geoff knows
  the issues and thinks he knows how to fix it, he just needs the time.
  owner: geoff

* it looks like glue_pod is not working anymore, consider dropping it
  completely and simply install .pod files along with .pm ones. In
  which case we need to arrange for Makefile.PL to traverse into
  docs/api/ and grab those pod files. See how the Template package
  does that.

  in any case we now have .pod manpages for non-existing .pm files, so
  in case we don't install .pod files as is, we may need to make a
  special case for those .pod files.  So it's probably better to just
  install all .pod files w/o glueing them to .pm files.

* some autogenerated record accessors shouldn't be get/set but only
  get (e.g. Apache->server->is_virtual(1) is wrong). Need to add a new
  flag supported by MapUtil and map files, where we can say which
  accessors should be read-only owner: stas

* Apache::{Server,Process} classes:
  require mutex lock for writing (e.g. $s->(error_fname|error_log)
  Status: most likely some server/process datastructures aren't
  supposed to be modified at request time. So instead of mutex
  locking, we think we should simply have a flag that will be down
  during the startup and will allow methods modifying $s/$proc structs
  (the method will check that flag and if it's up it'll die). At the
  beginning of child_end it'll raise the flag and lower it at the end
  of child_exit.

* Fixing Apache->warn("foo")

  Report: http://mathforum.org/epigone/modperl-dev/noxtramcay/3D11A4E5.6010202@stason.org
  Thread: http://mathforum.org/epigone/modperl-dev/noxtramcay
  Status: pending Apache::Log compat issues, this and other methods
          might be dropped.

* per-server cleanups core dump or are otherwise ineffective
    Apache->server->process->pconf->cleanup_register(sub { ...  });
  Report: geoff

- cgi emulation: %ENV management:

   - %ENV is currently only saved/restored for the perl-script
     handler, i.e. changes to %ENV outside of a perl-script handler
     are not cleared.  of course, "clean" modules would use local() to
     modify %ENV, but there should be an option to save/restore
     globals outside of the perl-script handler

  STATUS: do the cleanup for all handlers, but provide a new config
  option so users can disable it if they know what they are doing.

* Apache::SizeLimit
  o Need to port tools that restrict the memory size used by processes
    for prefork mpms and develop new ones for threaded mpms. Need to
    work out the details of the implementation of the garbage
    collection thread for the threaded mpms as originally suggested by
    doug.  The issue with threads is that there is no way to know the
    thread's size, can we use B::Size and B::TerseSize?

    prefork:
        Apache::SizeLimit - Owner: perrin
        Apache::GTopLimit - Owner: stas
    threaded:
        Garbage Collector thread

  => Ideally the tools should work transparently with threaded and
  non-threaded mpms, but how?

* Apache::Resource

* It'd be nice to have PAUSE and the clients support packages with
  several versions, like mod_perl 1.0 and mod_perl 2.0, since once we
  release it any dependency on mod_perl will be resolved as mod_perl
  2.0, when mod_perl 1.0 may be required instead.

* Apache::Reload
  - needs to handle properly redefined subs warnings
  owner: gozer

* Apache->unescape_url{_info}:
  not yet implemented.  should be moved to Apache::Util
