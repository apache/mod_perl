* PerlPreConnectionHandler is implemented, but the 'void *csd' arg in
  the callback is ignored. will require a modification of
  modperl_callback_run_handlers to pass yet another optional argument.

  Status: most likely nobody will ever want to use this option, so
  don't waste time working on it.

* Apache::FakeRequest:
  since APR can be used outside of httpd, and we can alloc request_rec
  and similar structures, it should be possible to bootstrap an
  inside-httpd interface and outside-httpd interface.  its not really
  worthwhile looking at until APR actually installs its *.so or *.a
  libraries somewhere apxs can find them.  and, there's a bunch of util
  functions (e.g. URI stuff) that is supposed to move from httpd into
  apr-util.

* could add support for embedding apache directives into perl
  directives values, e.g. interpolating $ServerRoot

  PerlSwitches -I$ServerRoot/lib/perl

* Since now we have protocol modules, it'd be nice to have a similar
  thing to PerlCleanupHandler, which works only for HTTP requests. 
  It should probably be called PerlConnectionCleanupHandler.

  If we add it we should probably rename PerlCleanupHadndler to
  PerlRequestCleanupHandler and keep the old name as a deprecated alias.

  We could also have PerlServerCleanupHandler, but that's exactly what
  PerlChildExitHandler does. Consider having ServerCleanup as an alias.
