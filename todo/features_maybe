* PerlPreConnectionHandler is implemented, but the 'void *csd' arg in
  the callback is ignored. will require a modification of
  modperl_callback_run_handlers to pass yet another optional argument.

  Status: most likely nobody will ever want to use this option, so
  don't waste time working on it.
