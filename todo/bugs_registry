# Registry specific bugs #
##########################


* An open issue with chdir, which is process-scoped. Arthur Bergman
  has started the work on ex::threads::safecwd, which is discussed
  here: http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2002/06/11/threads.html?page=2

RegistryLoader:

- chdir() needs to be adjusted when RegistryCooker implements it

RegistryCooker:

- consider not to use $$ in debug tracing. Not all platforms give out
  a different pid for different threads.

- some problems with setting the DEBUG() constant based on the value of 
  Apache->server->dir_config('ModPerl::RegistryCooker::DEBUG')
