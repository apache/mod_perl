* protect registry classes from bad scripts which try to assassinate $r
  Report: http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=apache-modperl-dev&m=106153785129782&w=2
  Status: (stas) i'm not sure whether we really need this feature,
          since it's the first time in the last 6 years we had a
          problem with bad user code of this kind. let's keep it in
          the patches until we have a real need for it.
  Priority: very low

* An open issue with chdir, which is process-scoped. Arthur Bergman
  has started the work on ex::threads::safecwd, which is discussed
  here: http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2002/06/11/threads.html?page=2

RegistryLoader:

- chdir() needs to be adjusted when RegistryCooker implements it

RegistryCooker:

- consider not to use $$ in debug tracing. Not all platforms give out
  a different pid for different threads.

- some problems with setting the DEBUG() constant based on the value of 
  Apache->server->dir_config('ModPerl::RegistryCooker::DEBUG')
