This file tracks the current status
of the apache2-rename-unstable branch.

The general goals for this branch are:

 - remove Apache2.pm, withdrawing support for MP_INST_APACHE2.
 - rename all Apache::Foo -> Apache2::Foo
 - update Apache-Test.
 - update the 2.0 documentation.
 - merge with trunk, and resume the candidate process.

This is an unstable branch, because the renaming
process will impact all aspects of the codebase.
The first set of code commits are expected to break 
the build system; so we'll need to mark a few milestones
to prepare for the trunk merge.  joes suggests these:

TODO: remove Apache2.pm and MP_INST_APACHE2.
TODO: rename the modules, and bring the build 
      system back to a compilable state.
TODO: correct Apache-Test and the mp2 test suite,
      so all tests pass again.
TODO: port the 2.0 documentation.
