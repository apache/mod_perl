This file tracks the current status
of the apache2-rename-unstable branch.

The general goals for this branch are:

 - remove Apache2.pm, withdrawing support for MP_INST_APACHE2.
 - rename all Apache::Foo -> Apache2::Foo,
   including mod_perl -> mod_perl2
 - update Apache-Test.
 - update the 2.0 documentation.
 - merge with trunk, and resume the candidate process.

This is an unstable branch, because the renaming
process will impact all aspects of the codebase.
The first set of code commits towards the actual renaming
are expected to break the build system; so we'll need to 
mark a few milestones to prepare for the trunk merge.  
joes suggests these, s/TODO/DONE/ as each one is achieved:


DONE: rename the modules, and bring the build 
      system back to a compilable state.  This
      effort will leave all of the tests broken.

      joes volunteers to do this.

TODO: correct Apache-Test and the mp2 test suite,
      so all tests pass again.

      joes volunteers to do this.

TODO: remove Apache2.pm and MP_INST_APACHE2.
      This effort should not yield any test regressions.

TODO: port the 2.0 documentation.
