- test that we properly set the error-notes tably entry on 
  HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR (is sub-request check REDIRECT_ERROR_NOTES)
  o test with plain handlers
  o test with registry (as we set it twice? once in registry and once
    more in the handlers?)

  mp1 has some sort of related test in t/net/perl/server_error.pl:
  my $note = $r->prev->notes('error-notes')
