config features:
----------------

- make 'PerlSetVar $Foo value' work like 'local $Foo = value' 
  for the given location

- allow Perl*Handler's to have arguments in config files

- allow <Perl></Perl> configuration sections to have read access to internal
  configuration structures (would be nice if we could tie a %namespace::) 

- setuid/gid before running any Perl code

perl language features:
----------------------

- @ARGV magic, tie to query string

- sub handler : method ($) {}
  call $class->new($r) and pass the returned object as the first and
  only arg to the method handler

- some mod_perlIO/PerlIO type methods for xs modules? (e.g. Apache::Peek)

optimization features:
---------------------

- use 5.7.1+'s PerlIO rather than tied filehandles

- copy-on-write SvPVX

- hook Perl malloc into apr_pool

- for "compiled handlers" w/ ithreads manage SV allocation via
  server-lifetime apr_pool_t

- "garbage collector" thread to walk padlists looking for certain things
   worth releasing.

- "mip manager" thread to watch # of active interpreters,
  cloning/destroying when needed (rather than waiting for a request to
  trigger)

- use subpools per-callback/handler (might trim some memory bloat)
  note: creating subpools requires a malloc mutex lock with threaded
  mpms

api:
---

- improve the "stacked handlers" implementation, including:
  + allow push_handlers to have an additional argument, an array ref,
    which will be passed to the handler as arguments, e.g.
    $r->push_handlers("PerlHandler", \&some_sub, ['one', 'two', 'etc']);

modules:
-------

- Apache::Registry should check return value of the subroutine,
  e.g. for REDIRECT   

- should Apache::Registry use filename instead of vhost_name+uri?

- Apache::Registry should honor __END__ and __DATA__,

- core Apache::SubProcess w/ proper CORE::GLOBAL::{fork,exec} support

- Apache::compat has to be loaded before CGI.pm, other than
  documenting this issue, it's possible that we will add:

  #ifdef MP_APACHE_COMPAT
       modperl_require_module("Apache::compat");
  #endif

  if MP_APACHE_COMPAT Makefile.PL option is true, but this carries a
  performance hit, so this is just an option.


new modules:
-----------

- apache.pm: use apache '1.3b3';

misc new stuff:
--------------

- 'make html'

- 'make test_report'

apache features that would be neat for mod_perl:
-----------------------------------------------

- "autoload" hook for configuration directives
