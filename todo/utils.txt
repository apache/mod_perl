a helper tools/utils that we want/need to have:


- perldoc won't search pods under Apache2/ unless you have a PERL5LIB
  with Apache2 dirs. We could provide a custom version of modperl2doc:

  #!/usr/bin/perl
  use Apache2;
  use Pod::Perldoc;
  exit( Pod::Perldoc->run() ); 

- Changes files should be autogenerated from cvs logs.
 
  [ Ask thinks that's a really bad idea; such logs are rarely
    useful. Too verbose and nitty gritty detailed for their own good.
    "foo->sda fixed to be foo->sdb to fix foogo bug in blah" vs "fixed
    foogo bug in blah (patch from C. Ontributor)"

    I have always found the mod_perl change logs very useful and
    helpful in the current format.  
  ]

  http://www.red-bean.com/cvs2cl/ already does that, but we have an
  extra wish list:

  o \n after the list of files

  o the PR: Obtained from: Submitted by: Reviewed by: 
    could each be on their own line and omitted if there is no value
    (e.g. none of the current modperl-2.0 changes have a PR)

  o 2001-09-08 11:00  stas
    were expanded to the full name
    2001-09-08 11:00  Stas Bekman

  o if we could somehow skip the Apache-Test directory, since that
    ChangeLog should be in httpd-test/perl-framework
