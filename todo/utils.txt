a helper tools/utils that we want/need to have:

- Changes files should be autogenerated from cvs logs.

  http://www.red-bean.com/cvs2cl/ already does that, but we have an
  extra wish list:

  o \n after the list of files

  o the PR: Obtained from: Submitted by: Reviewed by: 
    could each be on their own line and omitted if there is no value
    (e.g. none of the current modperl-2.0 changes have a PR)

  o 2001-09-08 11:00  stas
    were expanded to the full name
    2001-09-08 11:00  Stas Bekman

  o if we could somehow skip the Apache-Test directory, since that
    ChangeLog should be in httpd-test/perl-framework
