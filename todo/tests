# test suite issues and improvements #

- As the number of tests grows it takes longer to start the test
  suite. Under threaded mpms it can take a very long time on a loaded
  machine (10 minutes and more). At the moment we keep on bumping the
  startup timeout, but there is always someone with a slower/more
  loaded machine, for whom this timeout is too low, and the tests
  suite misleadingly fails to start. So may be we must start thinking
  to split the existing test suite into several smaller suites (for
  example we already have a separate ModPerl-Registry test suite). If
  we do perl/ithreads* and any tests definging +Clone/+Parent tests
  should definitely be moved out from the main suite, as they cause
  the biggest overhead (due to perl_clone).
