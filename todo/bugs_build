OpenBSD 2.9 DSO Builds but won't start, with segfaults in the
                Perl lexer. I wasn't even able to start mp1-dso with
                the customly built perl (tried 5.6.1 .. 5.9.0)
                -- the segfault is again in lexer. It seems that
                the standard OpenBSD perl package has been heavily
                patched, when the core system perl 5.6.0 package was
                built, since I can run 'make test' on mp1-dso, but not
                with a customly built 5.6.0 with the same
                options. Since 2.9 is no longer supported by OpenBSD,
                there is no 5.6.1 or higher to try, so at this moment
                we simply give up on 2.9. We think that the static mp2
                build should work just fine (once it's available).

AIX     3.3 DSO Works with -berok to ignore linking errors (symbol
                resolution).  Should replace -berok with a proper
                symbol resolution at linking time, but I had not much
                success with using this approach (dlopen fails).

AIX   4.3.3 DSO reported to work with mod_perl_1.99_12 and 
                Apache 2.0.48/prefork mpm 
                but doesn't start with worker:

FreeBSD ??  DSO Works with non-threaded perl (4.8-RELEASE-5.2-RELEASE, 6.0-CURRENT)

                Static works OK!

* Need to cleanup functions only needed for certain build flavors
  (perlio/threads/etc) out of lib/ModPerl/WrapXS.pm:$ithread_exports
  and use the newer, simpler #ifdef technique (see modperl_io_apache_init
  for an example)

* we should stop generating xs/apache_*, at least for a reason that
  it's incomplete and will be never complete as we don't keep up with
  changes with ap_/apr_ namespace. Also we don't have the logic to
  handle cases where functions aren't available on certain
  platforms. Importing these unavailable functions may cause loading
  problems on some platforms (aix?). If developers need to import
  symbols from ap_/apr_ namespace they should use .exp files installed
  by httpd/apr/aprutil.

* we have a dependency check problem when xs/*/*.h use code from
  xs/modperl_xs*.h, when the latter change 'make' won't rebuild the
  dependant files

* Testing:
  Need to put Philippe's smoking test into the core
  -- shouldn't forget to test with perlio enabled and disabled

* mp2bug -- add the output of 'ldd httpd' to the report
[pgollucci volunteers]

* source_scan won't create Wrap/Foo/Bar.xs if
  xs/maps/modperl_functions.map defines only a boot section:
  MODULE=APR::IO PACKAGE=APR::IO BOOT=1 
  unless there is at least one function added to the .map file
