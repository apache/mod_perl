OpenBSD 2.9 DSO Builds but won't start, with segfaults in the
                Perl lexer. I wasn't even able to start mp1-dso with
                the customly built perl (tried 5.6.1 .. 5.9.0)
                -- the segfault is again in lexer. It seems that
                the standard OpenBSD perl package has been heavily
                patched, when the core system perl 5.6.0 package was
                built, since I can run 'make test' on mp1-dso, but not
                with a customly built 5.6.0 with the same
                options. Since 2.9 is no longer supported by OpenBSD,
                there is no 5.6.1 or higher to try, so at this moment
                we simply give up on 2.9. We think that the static mp2
                build should work just fine (once it's available).

AIX     3.3 DSO Works with -berok to ignore linking errors (symbol
                resolution).  Should replace -berok with a proper
                symbol resolution at linking time, but I had not much
                success with using this approach (dlopen fails).

FreeBSD ??  DSO Works with non-threaded perl (4.8-RELEASE and
                5.1-RELEASE)
                http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=apache-modperl&m=106399870822612&w=2
                It doesn't work with threaded perl/worker mpm,
                seemingly because of the problems with threads on
                FreeBSD (not sure what version).


* we should stop generating xs/apache_*, at least for a reason that
  it's incomplete and will be never complete as we don't keep up with
  changes with ap_/apr_ namespace. Also we don't have the logic to
  handle cases where functions aren't available on certain
  platforms. Importing these unavailable functions may cause loading
  problems on some platforms (aix?). If developers need to import
  symbols from ap_/apr_ namespace they should use .exp files installed
  by httpd/apr/aprutil.

* gcc 3.3 (from cvs 2003-07-28) supports a new option:
  -Wdeclaration-after-statement, which we need to enable in the
  maintainer mode, to catch any declarations after statements, since
  by default gcc doesn't complain about them. Probably need to wait
  till gcc-3.3.2 and enable it then.

* Testing:
  Need to put Philippe's smoking test into the core
  -- shouldn't forget to test with perlio enabled and disabled

* mp2bug -- add the output of 'ldd httpd' to the report
