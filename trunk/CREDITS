=head1 NAME

CREDITS - The many mod_perl contributors 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

While Doug MacEachern is behind the majority of mod_perl's design,
code and documentation, he and mod_perl never would have made it this
far without the help from everyone in the mod_perl community.  His
heartfelt thanks goes out to all of you! 

There are thousands of people who have contributed to what mod_perl is
today.  This file is here to recognize the tremendous efforts of the
major contributors to the mod_perl effort.  

This file is generated by a Perl script which sorts by name.

present in the current mod_perl source, as the embedded model and
XS <-> Apache API interface were changed, it was an important

=head1 The Apache and Perl communities

If there was no Apache, there would be no mod_perl.

If there was no Perl, there would be no mod_perl.

We owe a great deal of thanks to The Apache Group, Larry Wall and the
perl5-porters, along with the communities that support them both.
